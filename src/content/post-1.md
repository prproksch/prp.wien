## About

About a year ago I began to be fascinated by software development and especially building websites.
After about two months of learning the basics I switched to the “Create Websites from Scratch” - Program hosted by Codecademy,
where I learned to create websites using HTML, CSS and basic JQuery to animate it.
While learning all these basics I completely dove into the coding community, started to watch YouTube videos and listening to podcasts (mainly Syntax.fm).
After completing the course I looked for the next target to tackle and chose GatsbyJS to create *„blazing fast“* and modern websites with ReactJS.

Since September 2019 I'm majoring in information technology at HTL Pinkafeld and I also started to educate myself about IT-Security & PEN-Testing.
