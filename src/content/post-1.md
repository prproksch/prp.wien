## About 
About a year ago I began to be fascinated by software development and especially building websites. 
After about two months of learning the basics I switched to the “Create Websites from Scratch” - Program hosted by <a href="https://www.codecademy.com" target="_blank">Codecademy</a> , 
where I learned to create websites using HTML, CSS and basic JQuery to animate it.
While learning all these basics I completely dove into the coding community, started to watch YouTube videos and listening to podcasts (mainly <a href="https://www.syntax.fm" target="_blank">Syntax.fm</a>). 
After completing the course I looked for the next target to tackle and chose <a href="https://www.gatsbyjs.org" target="_blank">GatsbyJS</a> to create *„blazing fast“* and modern websites with <a href="https://www.reactjs.org" target="_blank">ReactJS</a>.

Since September 2019 I'm majoring in information technology at <a href="https://www.htlpinkafeld.at" target="_blank">HTL Pinkafeld</a> and I also started to educate myself about IT-Security & PEN-Testing.
