## About

About a year ago I began to be fascinated by software development and especially building websites.
After about two months of learning the basics I switched to the “Create Websites from Scratch” - Program hosted by Codecademy,
where I learned to create websites using HTML, CSS and basic JQuery to animate it.
While learning all these basics I completely dove into the coding community, started to watch YouTube videos and listening to podcasts (mainly Syntax.fm).
On July 10 2020, I finished the „Front End Developer Nanodegree Program“ at Udacity.
I'm always enthusiastic about new technology and also educating myself about Frameworks, IT-Security & PEN-Testing.
