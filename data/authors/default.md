I started my journey towards Web Development in 2019, completing the Codecademy Course “Create Websites from Scratch”. After graduating, I was able to build simple Websites using HTML, CSS and JavaScript, and started diving deeper into the Web Development World.

About a Year, and a couple of little projects later, I enrolled in to the “Front End Web Development Nanodegree” by Udacity and finished it soon afterwards.
It gave me valuable experience with JavaScript, SCSS, Node.JS, Webpack, handling APIs and much more.

As I’m always enthusiastic about new technology, I’m currently learning React to create modern, fast and beautiful websites. I’m also learning about IT-Security & PEN-Testing at TryHackMe and Hackthebox.
